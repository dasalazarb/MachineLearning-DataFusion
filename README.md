This repository contains machine learning methods for data fusion integration. The data were obtained from the TCGA database. The Pipeline contains all the pre-processing of the data and training of the learners and Super Learners. There is a jupyter notebook (DeepLearningTCGA.ipynb or DeepLearningTCGAQuickVersion.ipynb) or a .py which can be run in spyder (spyderTCGAQuickVersion.py or spyderTCGA.py).
